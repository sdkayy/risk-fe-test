React/UI Engineer technical test task.

Implement a simple Next.JS application, share the source code via GitHub, and deploy it (using, e.g., render.com or Netlify) so that we can test it.

0. Ensure the end result test application has an appealing and beautiful user interface and clean implementation code.
1. Add a selector of the trading token pairs. You can offer the same pairs or even similar user experiences as, for example, you can see on https://www.matcha.xyz

2. Once the pairs are chosen, you can use https://docs.0x.org/0x-orderbook-api/api-references/get-orderbook-v1 to retrieve the current state of the order book and display it on the screen.
   In a similar way, as you can see, e.g. here:
   https://www.bybit.com/trade/inverse/BTCUSD
   https://ibb.co/r0pyHfK
3. You can subscribe to this WebSocket service to get real-time order book updates and again reflect them on the user interface. https://docs.0x.org/0x-orderbook-api/api-references/websocket-api
